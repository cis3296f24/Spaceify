# Spaceify

Project Abstract
Spaceify is inspired by the many web applications like Reciptify, Instafest, Icebergify, etc. that reimagine new ways to visualize Spotify's listening data. Spaceify will display a user's top tracks in the past month, 6 months, and all-time in a new unique fashion. The user will be able to visually view their listening history in an aesthetic and fun manner as well as share it with their friends.

Conceptual Design
I aim to create an interactive, aesthetic, space-themed scatter plot that visualizes a Spotify userâ€™s top tracks over different durations. In terms of hardware, it should be able to run on any machine with moderate specs. Linux systems would likely be ideal for development though windows or mac can also be used.
My application will most likely be running on Node.js, and I will use several programming languages throughout the process. This will include HTML & CSS, Javascript, and Python. Flask may be used for user authentication and React for building UI. I may also use D3.js or plotly for data visualization. I will need the Spotify Web API for fetching data.
